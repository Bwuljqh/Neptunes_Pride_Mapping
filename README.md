# Neptunes_Pride_Mapping
 
Mapping program in python 3 made for the game [Netpune's Pride](https://np.ironhelmet.com/).

## How to use
The program relies on the Api provided by the game. To use it you must get an Api code (avaiblable in options > API) and the number of the game.
Create a `data.json` file similar to `data.json.example`, replacing `codes` and `game_number` with yours.

Run the python file, the current result is a plot which you can save.

## Parameters
You can decide to show the troops on the systems, the natural ressources or the ressources with terraformation.
The fleets' size can either be all the same or dependant on their troops, the orders can either be not present, the current one or all of them.

All of that is dependant on visibility in the game.
